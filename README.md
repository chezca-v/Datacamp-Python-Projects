# 🐍 DataCamp Python Projects — chezca-v

This repository contains Python projects and exercises completed through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) as part of my learning journey in data science and programming.

Each folder includes a hands-on project where I applied Python to solve real-world problems using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- Data wrangling using `pandas`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Predictive modeling using `scikit-learn`
- Working with `.csv` datasets
- Real-world problem solving with Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chezca-v/Datacamp-Python-Projects.git
   cd Datacamp-Python-Projects
2. Open any .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or Google Colab.

3. Run the cells step-by-step and review code comments and visualizations.
